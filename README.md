Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail sales data involves examining and understanding the data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Key steps include:
Data Loading and Cleaning: Import the dataset, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarize key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and distribution of sales across different categories.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time, identifying seasonal patterns, peaks, and dips in sales.
Customer and Product Analysis: Evaluate customer behavior, segment customers, and assess product performance to identify best-sellers and underperformers.
Data Visualization: Use charts, graphs, and plots to visually represent the data, making it easier to spot trends and correlations.
Actionable Insights: Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for improving sales strategies, optimizing inventory, and targeting key customer segments.
